title: Quick Start Template
---

Selene offers a quick start template you can use to start creating your bundles. This template includes a basic bundle file structure and a simple example script to get you started.

The template can be found on GitHub at [SeleneRP/selene-bundle-starter](https://github.com/SeleneRP/selene-bundle-starter).
